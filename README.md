# Metabolic Atlas

## Introduction

Welcome to the codebase for the Metabolic Atlas project.

The front-end uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), with help of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). 

The back-end uses [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the database.

To learn more about the project, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/hma-prototype/wiki).

## Prerequisites
Docker, along with docker-compose, is used to manage the dependencies of this project. 

To install docker, download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) (docker-compose should be installed along with the process).


## Get started

TODO: add description about importing database

Add a `postgres.env` file based on the `postgres.env.sample` file:

```bash
$ cp postgres.env.sample postgres.env
```

Modify the `postgres.env` 

Edit `backend/metabolicatlas/settings.py`, replace the `DATABASES = â€¦` section with:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.getenv('POSTGRES_DB'),
        'USER': os.getenv('POSTGRES_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('POSTGRES_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': 'db',
        'PORT': 5432,
    }
}
```



To get a list of helper commands:

```bash
$ source proj.sh
```

Then you will get access to the following commands:

* To bootstrap the project: `$ build-stack`
* To run the project: `$ start-stack`
* To display real-time logs: `$ logs`
* To stop the project: `stop-stack`
* To create new migrationfiles: `db-make-migrations`
* To run a database migration: `db-migrate`
* To create a django superuser: `create-su`


## Collaboration
A simplified version of gitflow is used. The three kinds of branches are:

1. the `master` branch
2. the `develop` branch
3. `feature/<FEATURE_NAME>` branches

Whenever you start working on a new feature, create a feature branch called `feature/<FEATURE_NAME>` based on the `develop` branch.

```bash
$ git checkout develop
$ git checkout -b feature/<FEATURE_NAME>
```

After you are done with the feature, make a [pull request](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/hma-prototype/compare) from the `feature/<FEATURE_NAME>` branch to the `develop` branch. After the pull request has been reviewd and merged, the `feature/<FEATURE_NAME>` branch can be deleted.

When it is time to deploy a new version, create a [pull request](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/hma-prototype/compare) from `develop` to `master`. After reviewing and merging the pull request, create a `tag` to mark the current version and push it to github. The `tag` name should be `v` followed with the version number, for example `v1.1`.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git tag v1.1
& git push origin v1.1
```
